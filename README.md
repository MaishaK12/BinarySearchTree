# BinarySearchTree
A little practice on Binary Search Trees.

Implement the inorder method in binary search tree using a stack instead of recursion. 
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 15 integers, stores them in a binary search tree, and invokes the inorder method to display the elements.
